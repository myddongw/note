ElasticSearch: How to query a date field using an hours-range filter

Currently, I already know how to filter a days range from a (timestamp) date field. That's an easy one:

"range": {
    "date": {
        "gte": "2015-11-01",
        "lte": "2015-11-30"
    }
}
But how to filter dates when you are interested in ranges based on hours like gte:"8:00:00" and lte:"10:00:00"? Is this possible?

My requirement in other words: How to get all the events happening this month (15-11-01/15-11-30) but only between 8:00:00 am and 10:00:00?

Between those hours, for any day? – Nathan Tuggy Nov 5 '15 at 1:49
Let's say I want to get all the records between 2015-10-01 and 2015-12-31, but only those that happened between this hour range: "8:00:00" and "10:00:00" – xtingray Nov 5 '15 at 1:53

Similar question, but not the same. In the other one, I assume that there is another field called "time", that changes the problem. – xtingray Nov 5 '15 at 18:50

You can do it with your range filter to filter the correct days and then with a script filter to filter the desired hours, like this:

{
  "query": {
    "filtered": {
      "filter": {
        "bool": {
          "must": [
            {
              "range": {
                "date": {
                  "gte": "2015-11-01",
                  "lte": "2015-11-30"
                }
              }
            },
            {
              "script": {
                "script": "doc.date.date.getHourOfDay() >= min && doc.date.date.getHourOfDay() <= max",
                "params": {
                  "min": 8,
                  "max": 10
                }
              }
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
Note that you need to make sure to enable dynamic scripting in order for this query to work.

Thank you. It works perfect. By the way, I tried to add another script to filter minutes using the method "getMinuteOfHour" but it didn't work. Any suggestion? – xtingray Nov 5 '15 at 15:30
Can you show that script? – Val Nov 5 '15 at 15:36
Hi @Val could you please tell me from where getHourOfDay() method comes? does groovy script engine uses joda for datetime manipulation? I could not find any documentation – ChintanShah25 Dec 24 '15 at 22:24
@ChintanShah25 yep, doc['field'].date returns a Joda MutableDateTime object for all fields of type date or long. Agreed, it's not explicitly mentioned in the official docs, but you can find that info the original ticket from 2010. – Val Dec 25 '15 at 5:11

If I understood your question correctly then I think you have to add new field which indexes only time like

PUT your_index
{
  "mappings": {
    "your_type": {
      "properties": {
        "time": {
          "type":   "date",
          "format": "HH:mm:ss"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
Then you can query like this

{
  "query": {
    "bool": {
      "must": [
        {
          "range": {
            "date": {
              "gte": "2015-11-01",
              "lte": "2015-11-30"
            }
          }
        },
        {
          "range": {
            "time": {
              "gte": "08:00:00",
              "lte": "10:00:00"
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
Does this help?

Right now, my field "date" has this type: {"type":"date","format":"dateOptionalTime"}, it supports records like this 2015-11-04T22:10:02 and unfortunately I can't modify my indexes – xtingray Nov 5 '15 at 3:03 
even in my application, I have the same format but thing is you can only search like "gte" : "2015-10-02T13:34:09", "lte" : "2015-10-05T12:00:00" which will give you results between that range and not what you want which is specific time range on specific days – ChintanShah25 Nov 5 '15 at 3:08

Here's what I once used to only get results from start of current day to 6pm:

{
  "query": {
    "bool": {
      "must": [
        {
          "query_string": {
            "query": "(log_message:\"My Search String\")"
          }
        },
        {
          "range": {
            "@timestamp": {
              "time_zone": "CET",
              "gt": "now-24h/d",
              "lte": "now-24h/d+18h"
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
the important part is "now-24h/d" which will round to midnight / begin of current day, although it is a bit tricky as it depends on whether you use gt/lt(e), see reference doc for details.
